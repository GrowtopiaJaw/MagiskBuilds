# Magisk Builds

## Description

This Magisk custom update channel provides up-to-date Magisk builds from my
fork of @topjohnwu's original sources. This will typically include minor
patches to fix bugs and/or produce a universally installable build.

This fork currently includes 64 bit binaries (to avoid misidentification of
the kernel as 32 bit by apps like Phone Info and DevCheck), plus a patch to
allow Magisk to install on Samsung Galaxy S9/S9+ (G960F/G965F) devices.

To use this custom channel, configure the following URL in your Magisk Manager
settings:
