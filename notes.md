### Build: 2020042401
#### app: v7.5.2
#### Magisk: v20.5-b151d2f3

- 2aede977: scripts: fix find_block false positives /dev/log/kernel and /dev/BOOT - try /dev/block first with full depth to catch all platform/soc variations to the by-name directory, and the new dynamic partition /dev/block/mapper - next try uevent for block devices as before - lastly try /dev with maxdepth 1 (immediate directory) to find /dev/bootimg, /dev/recovery, etc. while avoiding /dev/log/kernel - move bootimg higher in the list than boot so /dev/bootimg gets found first and avoids /dev/BOOT - recovery_a/_b now also exists - minor touch-ups for readability and consistency
- 9b8a5e9b: scripts: add author name back to module install banner print
- 0f910f2d: scripts: ensure system is able to be mounted rw before attempting - this is needed for installations on Lineage 17.1 Recovery (AOSP Q) for logical partition devices, which uses /dev/block/mapper to stage the partitions
- 15f15510: Rewrite skel_node mounting and construction logic
